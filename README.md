<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p> This project focuses on user and warehouse management within a web application. </p>
<h4>Admin</h4>
<p> Admin users can easily perform various management tasks, including adding, updating, deleting, and listing users; managing warehouses (add, update, delete, list); and managing sub-warehouses (add, update, delete, list). Additionally, users and warehouse data can be exported to Excel, and search functions allow for quick retrieval of information. The system ensures that each operation is completed smoothly and without errors, providing a successful confirmation or detailed error explanations as needed.</p>
